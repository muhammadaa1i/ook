# Cart Quantity Validation Implementation

## Problem
The original cart system allowed users to add any quantity of products to their cart without checking if the requested quantity exceeded the available stock. This could lead to situations where users could order more items than available in inventory.

## Solution
Implemented comprehensive stock validation in the cart system:

### Changes Made

#### 1. CartContext.tsx
- **Stock Validation**: Added checks to ensure cart quantities don't exceed product inventory
- **Minimum Order Logic**: Maintains the business rule of minimum 50 units, multiples of 5
- **Smart Quantity Adjustment**: When requested quantity exceeds stock, automatically adjusts to maximum possible quantity (rounded to nearest 5)
- **User Feedback**: Provides clear toast notifications for different scenarios:
  - Out of stock products
  - Insufficient stock (less than minimum 50)
  - Limited stock (adding maximum available instead of requested)

#### 2. ProductCard.tsx
- **Enhanced Availability Display**: Shows detailed stock information including when stock is too low for minimum order
- **Button State Management**: Disables add-to-cart button when stock is insufficient
- **Visual Indicators**: Different overlays for out-of-stock vs insufficient-stock products
- **Improved Tooltips**: Context-aware tooltips explaining why a product cannot be ordered

#### 3. Translation Updates
- Added new translation keys for stock-related messages in Russian
- Provides clear user feedback in multiple languages

### Validation Rules

1. **Out of Stock (quantity = 0)**: 
   - Cannot add to cart
   - Shows "Out of Stock" overlay
   - Error toast when attempting to add

2. **Insufficient Stock (0 < quantity < 50)**:
   - Cannot add to cart (below minimum order quantity)
   - Shows "Insufficient Stock" overlay
   - Error toast explaining minimum requirement

3. **Limited Stock (quantity >= 50 but less than requested)**:
   - Adds maximum possible quantity (rounded down to nearest 5)
   - Warning toast showing adjusted quantity
   - Still allows adding to cart with adjusted amount

4. **Sufficient Stock (quantity >= requested amount)**:
   - Normal behavior, adds requested quantity
   - Success toast confirming addition

### User Experience Improvements

- **Visual Feedback**: Color-coded overlays (gray for out-of-stock, yellow for insufficient)
- **Clear Messaging**: Specific error messages explaining why an action failed
- **Quantity Display**: Shows available quantity with context about ordering requirements
- **Smart Adjustment**: Automatically suggests maximum possible quantity instead of failing entirely

### Example Scenarios

**Scenario 1**: Product has 30 units in stock
- Result: Cannot add to cart (insufficient for minimum 50)
- UI: Shows "Insufficient Stock" overlay, button disabled
- Message: "Product Name: Insufficient stock (30 available, minimum 50 required)"

**Scenario 2**: Product has 75 units in stock, user tries to add 100
- Result: Adds 75 units instead
- UI: Normal add-to-cart flow
- Message: "Product Name: Only 75 units added (75 available)"

**Scenario 3**: Product has 200 units in stock, user adds 50
- Result: Normal behavior, adds 50 units
- UI: Standard success feedback
- Message: "Product Name: +50 units added"

This implementation ensures inventory consistency while providing a smooth user experience with clear feedback and intelligent handling of edge cases.
